# Reasons why the M-94 has a lot of combos
* Since the letters are randomized on each dial, there are 26! different arangemnes of each dial
*Since there are 25 disks, the are 24! different combanations that the cipher can be aranged (the 17th dial on is always a set dial)\
*There is no set row that the cipher comes form, so you have to turn the dials asn read which everone is english (26 different cobinations)
# Therefore, there are 26! * 24! * 24 different cobinations that can exist
