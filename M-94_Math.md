# Reasons why the M-94 has a lot of combos
* Since the letters are randomized on each dial, there are 26! different arangments of each dial
* Since there are 25 disks, the are 24! different combanations that the cipher can be aranged (the 17th dial on is always a set dial)\
* There is no set row that the cipher comes form, so you have to turn the dials and read which ever one is english (26 different cobinations)
* The key can change for every 25 characters.
# Therefore, there are 26! * 24! * 24 different combination that can exist for a 25 letter encrytion
* This is approximately 2.5022 x 10^50 combinations!!!!
