# Conclusion

The conclusion the Playfair Cipher was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone, but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cipher. The technique encrypts pairs of letters instead of single letters as in the simple cipher.It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment.
