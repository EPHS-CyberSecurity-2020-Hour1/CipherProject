# Mathematic Anyalsis

### What is the mathmatic analysis? 
The Fairplay Cipher was the first practical digraph substitution cipher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone. The key square is a 5×5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting the cipher. Each of the 25 alphabets must be unique and one letter of the alphabet is taken from the table. But if both the letters are in the same column take the letter below each one. But at the same time if both the letters are in the same row: Take the letter to the right of each one
