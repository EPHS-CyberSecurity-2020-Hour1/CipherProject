# Playfair Cipher Mechanics

### How Playfair Cipher Works
Letters are placed on a 5x5 grid. They are usually in alphabetical order with the J usually removed and replaced with I, and broken into groups. The key then tells a specific word or random letters that will help you decode the message. Certain letters will correspond with other letters, and will end up being symmetric.

### About Encryption and Decryption
Since the Fairplay Cipher is symmetric, it encrypts and decrypts in the same way, making one key even more useful.
