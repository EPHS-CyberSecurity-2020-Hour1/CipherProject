# Playfair Cipher Mechanics

## How It Works
### Letters are placed on a 5x5 grid. They are commpletely mixed up, and broken into groups. The key then tells a specific word or random letters that will help you decode the message. Certain letters will correspond with other letters, and will end up being symmetric.

## Encryption and Decryption.
### Since the Fairplay Cipher is symmetric, it encrypts and decrypts in the same way, making one key even more useful.
