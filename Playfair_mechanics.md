# Playfair Cipher Mechanics

### How Playfair Cipher Works
Letters are placed on a 5x5 grid. They are in alphabetical order with the J usually removed and replaced with I, and broken into groups. The key then tells a specific word or random letters that will help you decode the message. Certain letters will correspond with other letters, and will end up being symmetric.

### About Encryption and Decryption
Since the Fairplay Cipher is symmetric, it encrypts and decrypts in the same way, making one key even more useful.

### Example:
A message ,"HELLO ONE AND ALL", would become "HE LX LO ON EA ND AL AL LX", after encoding it because there is double L between hello so we put a x inbetween them. Also there are uneven amounts of letters and spaces together so we put an, "X" at the end. After you encrypt this, it would be,"KC NV MP PO AB OC FQ NV". When you decrypt this, it becomes,"HE LX LO ON EA ND AL LX" which is what we started with.
