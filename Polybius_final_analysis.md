# Final Analysis
## Why was it useful?
> Polybius cipher was almost unbreakable until people figured out what frequency analysis is. This code was useful because it was simple and easy to use. For example, vietnam prisoners were able to use it by tapping the numbers of the code in order to speak to each other. 
## Similar Cipher
>A very similar code is the Ceasar cipher which is a type of substitution cipher where all the letters are moved from to the left or right.
