# History
> The Polybius Square was created by a scholar, Polybius, in ancient Greek times. It consisted of a 5 by 5 grid which worked perfectly for the Greek alphabet of 24 letters. In the english alphabet, there is 26 letters which does not fit within a 5 by 5 grid. To solve this, we either use a 6 by 6 grid or we group up 2 letters together so it would fit in a 5 by 5.
