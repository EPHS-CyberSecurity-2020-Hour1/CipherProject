# History
## When was this cipher created?
> The Polybius Square was created by a scholar, Polybius, in ancient Greek times. It consisted of a 5 by 5 grid which worked perfectly for the Greek alphabet of 24 letters. In the english alphabet, there is 26 letters which does not fit within a 5 by 5 grid. To solve this, we either use a 6 by 6 grid or we group up 2 letters together so it would fit in a 5 by 5.
## Who used this cipher?
> This cipher was mainly used in the Greek times after Polybius created it, but it was also used during the vietnam war. During the vietnam war, prisoners would "tap" out the numbers instead of writing the numbers in order to talk to each other without the guards knowing. The first number of taps was for the row number, the second number of taps was for the column number.
