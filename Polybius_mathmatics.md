# Mathmatics
## Number of Keys
> Since the polybius cipher has 26 different letters, if you multiply 26*25*24...2*1 you will get over 100 trillion keys. 
## How to decode without key
> To decode a message without a key you would need to use frequency analysis. Frequency analysis is looking for patterns in the code. For example, looking for the word "the" and then matching the letters with the word "the" to other parts in the code.
