## Number of Keys
> Since the polybius cipher has 26 different letters, if you multiply 26 * 25 * 24...2 * 1 you will get over 100 trillion keys. 
## How to decode without key
> To decode a message without a key you would need to use frequency analysis. Frequency analysis is looking for patterns in the code. For example, looking for the word "the" in the code by looking for 3 letters in a word.
