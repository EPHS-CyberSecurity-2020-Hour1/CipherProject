# Mechanics
## How does it work?
> Each letter is then represented by its coordinates in the grid. For example, "BAT" becomes "12 11 44". The 26 letters of the Latin/English alphabet do not fit in a 5 Ã— 5 square, two letters must be combined (usually I and J as above, though C and K is an alternative).
## How to decode
> If you know how the Polybius cipher is setup then it is pretty easy to decode. You just match the numbers with the letters and decode the message.
