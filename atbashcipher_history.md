# Atbash Cipher
The Atbash cipher is monoalphabetic and Hebrew in origin.  
The Atbash cipher encrypts by mapping the alphabet to the same alphabet in reverse order  

In the english alphabet, it would look like this  
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z  
:arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small::arrow_down_small:  
Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A  

This cipher does not use any keys and only varies in the language used for the cipher.  
This cipher is extremely easy to break by either discovering that it is Atbash or assuming it is a substitution cipher.  
Atbash cipher was one of the earliest known substitution ciphers, but in modern-day, it is too simple to be viable.  

### Final Conclusion
The Atbash cipher was one of the original substitution ciphers, but in modern-day, it's simplicity limits it's usage.
