# Analysis: 
This cipher offers very little communication security, as it is a substitution cipher. As such all the methods used to cryptanalyse substitution ciphers can be used to break Baconian ciphers. The main advantage of the cipher is that it allows hiding the fact that a secret message has been sent at all.
Bacon's Cipher stopped being useful because newer forms of code has started to come out, and it's harder to decode a message without a key. Bacon's Cipher was useful because it was very difficult to decode, because it only had one key.
Bacon's Cipher was used to hide messages hidden in plain sight.
