# History
Bacon's cipher or the Baconian cipher is a method of steganography devised by Francis Bacon in 1605. 


These were sequences of 'A's and 'B's e.g. the letter 'D' was replaced by 'aaabb', the letter 'O' was replaced by 'abbab' etc.


The Bacon's Cipher was used for hiding secrets in messages
