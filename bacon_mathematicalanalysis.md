Bacon's Cipher has 2 keys, 1 key contains I,J, and U,V, and I,J, and U,V all have the same code. While the other one has a code for every letter. 
It would be really hard to decode the message without a key.
But you could add the number, create a pattern, and then recreate the key. (Which would be very time consuming.)
