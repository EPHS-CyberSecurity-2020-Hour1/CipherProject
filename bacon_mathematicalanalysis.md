# Mathematical Analysis:
The Baconian cipher is a substitution cipher in which each letter is replaced by a sequence of 5 characters. ... Each letter is assigned to a string of five binary digits. These could be the letters 'A' and 'B', the numbers 0 and 1 or whatever else you may desire.
Bacon's Cipher has 2 keys, 1 key contains I,J, and U,V, and I,J, and U,V all have the same code. While the other one has a code for every letter. 
It would be really hard to decode the message without a key.
But you could add the number, create a pattern, and then recreate the key. (Which would be very time consuming.)
