# Book Cipher - A History
## By Sarah Sumrall and Sudeeksha Nooka

#### Introduction
  Even though, we don't know much about the Book Cipher's origin - we know it is one of the most popular types of ciphers used throughout the middle to modern centures. However, it got its name from being used to pass messages between morally debatable individuals through books - ranging from royalty to soldiers. 
#### Key information
  The book cipher key is some aspect of the individual book. It could be the book edition, the font of the text, or individual pages of the book. The use of literature - being common and widely available in modern times, was more convenient for this use than objects made specifically for cryptographic purposes. According to a source: "Traditionally book ciphers work by replacing words in the plaintext of a message with the location of words from the book being used. In this mode, book ciphers are more properly called codes."
  According to another source: "Jacobus Silvestri, one of the ancestors of cryptography, was the first to describe a true book cipher. He recommended the use of a codebook as a means of concealing information and devised a sort of dictionary with root words placed in multiple columns. Every row and column is assigned a unique symbol and additional symbols were allocated to commas, question marks and other grammatical inflections."
