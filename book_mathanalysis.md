# Book Cipher Math Analysis
## By Sarah Sumrall and Sudeeksha Nooka

#### Keys and Code Words
* Unlimited options for keys, since you can use any book, any paragraph, and start at any sentence 
* For example:
  * Say you are trying to encrypt a message using the book Romeo and Juilet
  * You can start your key from (near the start of the book):
1. But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
2. Should in the farthest east begin to draw
3. The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
4. Away from light steals home my heavy son
5. And private in his chamber pens himself,
6. Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
7. And makes himself an artificial night.
8. Black and portentous must this humor prove,
9. Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
  * Or you could start your key from (end of the book): 
1. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
2. Within this hour my man shall be with thee
3. And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
4. Which to the high topgallant of my joy
5. Must be my convoy in the secret night.
6. Farewell. Be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains.
7. Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
