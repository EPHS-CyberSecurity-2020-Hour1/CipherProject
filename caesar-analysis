The caesar cipher is a very simple encryption method, so using a brute force tool is very effective in solving it.
Brute force is a way of decrypting that just tries every possible key until it gets the correct one, but this becomes much harder when ciphers get more complicated.
Because the cipher is based off of shifting the alphabet over, there is only 25 possible keys. In modern times, a brute force machine can crack that in milliseconds.
