The caesar cipher is a very simple encryption method, so using a brute force tool is effective in solving it.
Brute force is a way of decrypting that tries every possible key until it gets the correct one, but this becomes much harder when ciphers get complicated.
Because the cipher is based off of shifting the alphabet over, there is only 25 possible keys. A brute force mechanism can crack this in milliseconds.
If you didn't have the key, the most straightforward method would be using a brute force machine or doing it by hand. If you're wondering why you can't make this
cipher harder to crack by simply scrambling the alphabet, you can. But then it's no longer considered a caesar cipher.
Overall, the mathematical complexity of this cipher is extremely low, and most people could understand how it works.
