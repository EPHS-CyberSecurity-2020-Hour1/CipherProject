Caeser Cipher
<h1>
This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, and according to his biographies he used it for military communications. His version of it shifted the letters 3 spaces 
over, so that "E" would become "H" when encrypting, and the reverse while decrypting.In modern times this cipher is considered simple and unsafe. However, it was 
likely very effective during the time period, seeing as most of Caesar's enemies were illiterate and didn't know the key yet. Breakable as it is, the cipher is 
still being used today, albeit not for legitimate security purposes. It can be found in games, puzzles, and also newspapers.

Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest ciphers made, one website that will decode and encode with this cipher is https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/caesar-cipher. 

Something that made this cipher so useful was how easy it was to learn it, just like most/any monoalphabetic ciphers the cipher was just shifting it by 3 so many
found this simple to do.

The cipher technique was developed in 100 BC and has been used since, although many ciphers were developed years since, 
Caesar is one of the best known. 

Although years later this cipher was found to be the most "embarassing" and least secure ciphers nor is any other monoalphabetic substitution cipher, because it is 
so simple that is was made is so unsecure since people would be able to encode it quickly and very easily. This technique is still used by some today but isn't 
considerd the "best" nor most secure cipher at all.
