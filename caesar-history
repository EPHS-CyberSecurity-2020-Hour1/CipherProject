Caeser Cipher
<h1>
This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, and according to his biographies he used it for military communications. His version of it shifted the letters 3 spaces 
over, so that "E" would become "H" when encrypting, and the reverse while decrypting.In modern times this cipher is considered simple and unsafe. However, it was 
likely very effective during the time period, seeing as most of Caesar's enemies were illiterate and didn't know the key yet. Breakable as it is, the cipher is 
still being used today, albeit not for legitimate security purposes. It can be found in games, puzzles, and also newspapers.
