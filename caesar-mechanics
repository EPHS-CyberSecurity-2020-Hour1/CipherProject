The caesar cipher is argueably the one of the most simple ciphers out there. In messages, each letter is assigned to a different letter in the alphabet. 
This is done by shifting the alphabet a certain number of places.
For example, let's say your plaintext is 
>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Your cipher is 
>UVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST 
If you want a message to say HELLO, it would be
encrypted as BYFFI. The "key" for caesar ciphers is the number that the letters are shifted, so in this instance the key is 6.
