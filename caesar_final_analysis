Final Analysis 
<h1>
Although years later this cipher was found to be the most "embarassing" and least secure ciphers nor is any other monoalphabetic substitution cipher, because it is 
so simple that is was made is so unsecure since people would be able to encode it quickly and very easily. This technique is still used by some today but isn't 
considerd the "best" nor most secure cipher at all.

The thing that makes it very unsafe is how easy it is to code which then makes it as easy to encode/crack. Throughout the years more technology has been made and you
can now just search anything you want on google you can easily find a way to code using caser and encode it. Many consider this technique "foolish" and "too easy"
because it really is one of the simplest stratagies ever made.
