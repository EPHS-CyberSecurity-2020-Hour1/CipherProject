# Hill Cipher Final Analysis
###### By Kaleb and Logan

## Why Did it Stop Being Used?
### This coding technique mainly stopped being useful because of all the possible outcomes. There are 2 main softwares that can easily decode this cipher, so
### it isn't as secure as it once was.

## What Made it so useful when it was being used?
### Since there was 12 Sextillion *(12,303,585,972,327,392,870,400)* Possibilities for keys, when one was used, you could practically throw it away and there would
### still be just plenty of other keys to use. This made is very versatile.

## What are similar codes to the Hill Cipher?
### The other similar code to the Hill Cipher is *Matrix Decryption* (and also some other ciphers). Hill Cipher is partially based off of it, though also quite
### modified. Hill Cipher came around about 1930s, as Matrix Decryption was prior to that.
