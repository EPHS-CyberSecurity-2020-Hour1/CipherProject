# Why did people stop using it
its only a one time thing which isnt very efficient. Also, if you make a really hard cipher to brake you can just use that infinitely until it gets decoded. the person that recieves the key has to dspose of it and it just isnt the most efficient.
## Why it was used
it was used becase it is almost impossible to crack unless you have the key for it.
