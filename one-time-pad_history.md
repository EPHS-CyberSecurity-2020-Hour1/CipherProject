One Time Pad History - Frank Miller in 1882 was the first to describe the one-time pad system for securing telegraphy. The next one-time pad system was electrical. In 1917, Gilbert Vernam (of AT&T Corporation) invented and later patented in 1919 (U.S. Patent 1,310,719) a cipher based on teleprinter technology.
