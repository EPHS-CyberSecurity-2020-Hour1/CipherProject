<h2> Why did this stop being a useful code?
  <h5> Rail Fence stopped being a useful code due to the ease in which the cipher can be broken into.
Brute force attacks, for example, can quite easily run over this cipher. This is due to the smaller number of keys.
  
<h2> What made it useful when it was being used?
  <h5> The greeks invented it because it was easy to encrypt and decrypt messages. It was useful because the goal was 
accomplished, and in ancient times, sophisticated hacking methods were likely not discovered. 
  
<h2> What are other interesting uses of this code or similar codes?
  <h5> Since this is a transposition cipher, a method of encryption by which the positions held by characters are shifted
according to a system, the most similar cipher to it is the most common Ceasar Cipher. No other interesting uses.
