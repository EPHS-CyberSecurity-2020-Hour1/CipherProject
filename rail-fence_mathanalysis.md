<h2> How many possible keys or codes could there be?
  <h5> There isn't an exact number of how many keys or codes there could be. The key is based on the number of
lines of the rail fence

<h2> How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key?
  <h5> Each letter is written in a zigzag pattern across the page. 
    The ciphertext is then read off by writing the top row first, followed by the bottom row.

<h2> What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?
  <h5> The difficulty to solve the code depends on the lines needed to decrypt. The concept is fairly simple though.
