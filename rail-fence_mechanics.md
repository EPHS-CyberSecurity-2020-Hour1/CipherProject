<h2> How does this cipher work?

<h5> The plain text is written downwards and diagonally on successive "rails" of an imaginary fence, then moving up when the bottom rail is reached. When the top rail is reached, the message is written downwards again until the whole plaintext is written out. The message is then read off in rows.
