# Mathematical Analysis of Scytale
*How many possible keys or codes could there be? How would you attempt to decode this message if you didn't have a key. What is the mathematical complexity to solve the code?*

1. The key used in scytale ciphers depends on how many times letters you want on a band before it loops around.
2. In order to decode without this knowledge, the scytale would imply what you would need to do to crack it, have different sized rods and brute force it.
3. In regular text, all you would need is to put them in a list and then run a modulus to rearrange them.
