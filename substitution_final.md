# Conclusion

Ultimately, the substitution cypher is still applicabale and useful today, given you create a complex polyalphabetic key to encode with. In it's past, it was capable of taking military orders in the Caesar Cipher or simply what it is more used for today, which is teaching aspiring students about history of computer science and how it all ties together. The most interesting part of it all, is that the substution cipher is so large and so useful. It can be incredibly frustrating to decode if you are working by hand, and there is a lot of creastive ways that you can outsmart the system. Perhaps you create another language in the process of creating a substitution cipher. It's all very dependent on how much work and effort you put into it. To our group, that is what makes this cipher so incredibly broad and interesting.
