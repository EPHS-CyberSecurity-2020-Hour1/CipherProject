# Mathematical Analysis of the Substitution Cypher

The Subsitutiional Cipher has some interesting mathamatical capability to it, however, one would really need to be smart about how they go about making it. They need to be smart enough about how they encode text. If you were to shift a character 4 forward then you would have a pattern of character minus 4 on the alphabet. It really depends on what the cipher is, and how complex you are willing to make it. I suspect if you are willing to make it complex, then you could make a very complex and hard to crack subsitution cipher. Especially with other langauages. Imagine a ciper in Chinese or a language that is incredibly complex and has an absurd ammount of characters in the alphabet, especially when compared to English.
