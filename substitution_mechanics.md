# Mechanics of The Substitution Cypher

The Mechanics of A Subtitution Cipher is different for each, dependent on the method you use to encode, however the general idea of having a base alphabet and then a key to encode it stays the same. The methodscan be extremely conplex and mathamtical, or they could rely on literature or creativity. There is a lot of possibilites with this cipher, which is why it could still be viable, but there is just better ciphers. 

I bet you could come up with a simple substitution cipher quickly. Though patterns like double characters are the largest issue of any cipher.
