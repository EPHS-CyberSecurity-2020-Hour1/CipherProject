# History
Transposition cipher was used during wars to send secret messages to troops. The ancient Greeks used rail fence ciphers(a form of transposition cipher), and the Union Army in the American Civil War took advantage of route ciphers. Double transposition ciphers were used by the Germans in World War I, and the Allied and Axis Powers during World War II.
