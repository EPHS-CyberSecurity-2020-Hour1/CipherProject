# Mechanics
A transposition cipher is a rearrangement of the letters of the plaintext that will make the ciphertext look like it is well-encrypted. One example of a transposition cipher is the row transposition cipher.
Read from left to right first to see plaintext that will be encrypted by reading them top down first then left to right and the chosen key length is 4 if you count the amount of rows on the side and has the characters 'Z' as place holders to keep it even.

1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
---------------------------------
W | H | E | N | D | R | I | N | K
---------------------------------
I | N | G | W | A | T | E | R | R
---------------------------------
E | M | E | M | B | E | R | I | T
---------------------------------
S | S | O | U | R | C | E | Z | Z
---------------------------------

The encrypted message will read: WIESHNMSEGEONWMUDABRRTECIERENRIZKRTZ
